# Research

This is a place for me to gather my thoughts on what type of research
questions I want to ask. This is going to drive the entire process of
analyzing the data.

## Questions from other research projects

- What amenities can help predict footfall in city/town centres in the United Kingdom?
  - They used a machine learning approach to determine what drove footfall
  - Used a 300m radius around the footfall collectors
  - Added a bunch of tags to the predictors
- Are public green spaces distributed fairly? A nationwide analysis based on remote sensing, OpenStreetMap and census data
  - Which share of the German population have sufficient access to green space?
  - How is GS availability distributed in the German population beyond major cities, between rural and urban regions, or neighborhood housing types?
  - How does neighborhood population composition relate to green space availability? How does it differ between GLC and PGS?
